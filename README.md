## Description

This project analyzes public transit üöå accessibility across Wake County, North Carolina. It focuses on neighborhoods with the least access to bus routes and stops. The project combines the **2025 GoRaleigh GTFS data** which includes transit routes, stops, and schedules with **2022 U.S. Census** data on socioeconomic factors like car ownership, income, and household size.

Using a 400-meter buffer around bus stops, the analysis identifies neighborhoods outside typical transit reach. The goal is to highlight areas where transit service may be insufficient and explore how these areas relate to demographic characteristics. This helps inform transportation planning and improvements.
